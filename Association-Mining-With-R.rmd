# Association Mining (Market Basket Analysis)

> Association mining is commonly used to make product recommendations by identifying products that are frequently bought together. But, if you are not careful, in certain cases the rules can give misleading results. Read on to find out. 

Association mining is usually done on transactions data from a retail market or from an online e-commerce store. Since most transactions data is large, the `apriori` algorithm makes it easier to find these patterns or _rules_ quickly.

So, What is a _rule_? 

A rule has an _LHS_ and an _RHS_ part. It could look like this:

__item A => item B__

Meaning, the item/s on the right were frequently purchased along with items on the left. 

## How to measure the strength of a rule?

Once the `apriori()` generates all the rules from a given transaction data, it also shows the _support_, _confidence_ and _lift_ of these rules. These three measure can be used to decide which rules are strength enough. So what do these terms mean?

Lets consider the rule _A => B_ in order to compute these metrics. 

$$Support = \frac{Number\ of\ transactions\ with\ both\ A\ and\ B}{Total\ number\ of\ transactions} = P\left(A \cap B\right)$$

$$Confidence = \frac{Number\ of\ transactions\ with\ both\ A\ and\ B}{Total\ number\ of\ transactions\ with\ A} = \frac{P\left(A \cap B\right)}{P\left(A\right)}$$

$$Expected Confidence = \frac{Number\ of\ transactions\ with\ B}{Total\ number\ of\ transactions} = P\left(B\right)$$

$$Lift = \frac{Confidence}{Expected\ Confidence} = \frac{P\left(A \cap B\right)}{P\left(A\right).P\left(B\right)}$$


## Caveat with using Lift

#### A -> B

Support: P(A^B)

Confidence: P(A^B)/P(A)

Expected Confidence: P(B)

Lift: Confidence/Expected Confidence = P(A^B)/P(A).P(B)

#### B -> A

Support: P(A^B)

Confidence: P(A^B)/P(B)

Expected Confidence: P(A)

Lift: Confidence/Expected Confidence = P(A^B)/P(A).P(B)

#### Important Note
For both rules A -> B and B -> A, the value of lift turns out to be the same. This means we cannot use lift to make recommendation for a particular ‘rule’. It can merely be used to club frequently bought items into groups.

## Caveat with using Confidence

The _confidence_ of a rule can be a misleading measure while making product recommendations in real world problems, especially while making add-ons recommendations. Lets consider the following example transactions, where A: IPhone and B:Headset.

1. Iphone, Headset
2. Iphone, Headset
3. Iphone 
4. Iphone 

Lets consider the following rules: 

1. _Iphone -> Headset_
1. _Headset -> IPhone_ 

In real world, it would be realistic to recommend _headphones_ to a person who just bought an _iPhone_ and not the other way around. Imagine being recommended an iPhone when you just finished purchasing a pair of headphones. Not nice!.

While selecting rules from the `apriori` output, you might guess that higher the confidence a rule has, better is the rule. But for cases like this, the headset -> iPhone rule will have a higher confidence (2 times) over iPhone -> headset. Can you see why? The calculation below show how.

#### Confidence Calculation:
__iPhone -> Headset__: P(iPhone ^ Headset)/P(iPhone) = 0.5 / 1 = __0.5__

__Headset -> iPhone__: P(iPhone ^ Headset)/P(Headset) = 0.5 / 0.5 = __1.0__

As, you can see, the $headset -> iPhone$ recommendation has a higher confidence, which is misleading. So, confidence should not be the only measure you can use to make product recommendations.

So, you probably need to check more criteria such as the price of products before recommending items, especially in cross selling cases.
