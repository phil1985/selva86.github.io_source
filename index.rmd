# Welcome to r-statistics.co

An educational resource for those seeking knowledge related to machine learning and statistical computing in R.
Here, you will find quality articles, with working R code and examples where ever possible, where the goal is to make the [#rstats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats) concepts clear and simple to understand. 

This is built by keeping in mind, statisticians who are new to R programming language, R programmers without a stats background, analysts who work in SAS or python, college grads and developers who are relatively new to both R and stats/ML.
