# Welcome

This is an educational resource for those seeking knowledge related to machine learning and statistical computing in R.
Here, you will find quality articles, with working R code and examples where ever possible, where the goal is to make the concepts clear and simple to understand. 

This is built by keeping in mind, statisticians who are new to R programming language, R programmers without a stats background, analysts who work in SAS or python, college grads and developers who are relatively new to both R and stats/ML.
